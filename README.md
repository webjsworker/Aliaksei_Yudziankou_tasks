### About me 
  * I work in a factory. I like to learn something new. I first got experiance with IT in 2004. I worked with JS and HTML and that was my hobby, but now I want to change jobs and work as an IT developer. I prefere frontend. 
  * Knowledge of JS, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, REST API with EXPRESS, React-Redux, JSX, Flux vs Redux, TypeScript, Git. Littele bit C++ 
  * I study in RS school. 
  * I finished my master's degree in 2014. Master of Engineering Science.

### Sample code 
```
<script type="text/javascript">
console.log("Hello world!")
</script>
```

 It's simple function ` function square(number) { 
  return number * number; }` for understand.
